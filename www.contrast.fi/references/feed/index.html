				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SmarpShare is one of the fastest growing Nordic startups, and they asked us to create a 5-language site that is very modern, clean, and most of all helps them to sell. The main target group of SmarpShare are Fortune 1000 -companies, and that was our main concern during the design &#038; development process. The result: A fresh and clean site, that has completely tailored backend that is super easy to update by the Smarp staff. The site also features a vast blog environment (Employee Advocacy blog as well as a separate blog for the Smarp Tech team (<a href="http://tech.smarpshare.com" target="_blank">http://tech.smarpshare.com</a>).</p>
<p>The site has already helped Smarp land one of the most prestigious Fortune 1000 -companies as their client. Check screenshots of the site below!</p>

Shotti needed a completely renewed look and well-design user experience, to make sure visitors have the best and smoothest experience possible searching for recipes. We developed a highly customised and handcrafted WordPress+WooCommerce production, that serves up the 250+ recipes in a split second. We&#8217;re proud to say it is a recipe site like no other!</p>

We designed a friendly and clean website that is easy to use and gives user a fresh vibe of The Summer University. Technically, the website is features quite complicated API’s, for example one for the course system called Hellewi, which enables us to see the whole course collection on the site.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Finnish Ski Area Association chose Contrast as their partner to rebrand and renew their Ski.fi ski resort portal. The project was very interesting to us and close to our hearts, as all the members of the Contrast team are avid snowboarders. The real challenge was the tight schedule of the project.</p>
<p>The website needed a lot of customized solutions: All the ski resorts and ski schools had to be able to edit their data every day. For this purpose, we designed and coded a custom-made content management back-end for the resorts and schools. In order to present the huge amount of data in a readable way for the users, we visualized the data with modern charts and clean tables. We also built several API’s for the website, e.g for automatic data transfer into the teletext channels of all the major Finnish TV-channels.</p>
<p>See more about the project below!</p>

We designed the first version of the website as well as the needed material within two weeks for the event, which was a real success for Innorange.
